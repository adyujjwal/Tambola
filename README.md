# Tambola

Want to Play Tambola with your friend???

Your search is over as I have developed an application that allows any number of users to play Tambola/Housie in a Virtual meeting.

A static UI application developed using Angular that allows multiple people to play Tambola/Housie together over a Zoom/Teams meeting.

Steps to Play:

Step 1: Go to the following Link : https://tambola.netlify.app/

Step 2: Click on the button "Get Your Ticket Here" to get your ticket.

Step 3: Add your first name in the textbox and click on Add button.

Step 4: A new card will appear on the screen, Click on your name to open the ticket.

(The Host can use any Tambola number generator to call out the numbers).

Step 5: Click on the numbers when they are called out to keep a track of numbers that has been called.

Step 6: Enjoy!
